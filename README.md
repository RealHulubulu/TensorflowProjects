# TensorflowProjects

These are projects I have been developing using Tensorflow Estimators. I am using the tutorials found at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials
as a base for my projects. I want to create simple apps that utilize Tensorflow Estimators. This will allow for people to explore the power
behind machine learning, and specifically neural networks, in data analytics. All links are also found at the bottom of this file.

Update 6/10/2020: <br /> I added in three scripts. They all use the Estimator linear classifier found in the tutorials for Tensorflow. The tensorflowLinearEstimator.py
is just the tutorial but with some added crossed columns. The TensorflowEstimatorLinearClassifier_Cars_Dataset.py uses the same code from the
tutorial but on a different dataset from UC Irvine. The TensorflowEstimatorLinearClassifier_App.py is a general solution that works with any 
csv file with classification data. Currently it has 7 datasets you can try out and a custom option for adding in your own custom dataset. The
datasets are either from the tutorials for Tensorflow or from UC Irvine at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php.
